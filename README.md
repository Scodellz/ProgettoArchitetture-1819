# KeyGenerartor
The aim of this program is to generate the encryption (and decryption) key, for the [program]().

The program generates 4 text files, the number present in the file name indicates the length of the generated key.

This files are only temporary because will be used to perform encryption and decryption
tests during the development of the program.

When the program will be finished, only the file with 4 characters will be attached to it.

The name will be update to "chiave.txt".

# how to get the key files :
linux : before all we need to BUILD THE JAR
        
        0.get the file "build.barb"
        
        1.open a terminal                                       (in the current directory!)
        
        2.write the follow command: ./build.barb                (you can use tab for autocomplete) 
        
        it will generate the KeyGenerartor.jar
        
        3.write the follow command: java -jar KeyGenerartor.jar (you can use tab for autocomplete)
        
        it will generate the key files.
